title: Building R Shiny Applications
---

[R Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) is a platform developed by RStudio that enables R users to develop **interative** web applications without knowing HTML or other programming languages. 

##Getting Started
First, we need to install the shiny package.
<pre><code>install.packages('shiny')</code></pre>
For every shiny app, there are two core components: **ui.R** and **server.R**. ui.R defines how the application will look. server.R defines the underlying calculations.
